<div class="alert alert-danger text-center">
  As pointed out by commenter Thaj below, this information is now obselete.  One can install the default <b>arm-none-eabi-gcc</b> package provided in Ubuntu 14.04 and up without adding any special PPAs.
</div>

When I initially began using Contiki, the recommended GCC version for compiling ARM binaries was 4.9.3.

It is important not to use the `arm-none-eabi-gcc` package from the Ubuntu repos, because it cannot compile Contiki properly.

It is possible to install a working v4.9.3 of the ARM GCC using a PPA owned by Terry Guo.  Unfortunately, that PPA does not have any binaries for Xenial.  Fortunately, there is a different PPA with a newer version, v5.3.1, and which I have found does work in Ubuntu 16.04!

It should be noted that this newer version may be liable to have other bugs that have yet to be reported.  YMMV.  But -- if we must, we must.

First, make sure to uninstall whatever version you may or may not already have:

```bash
sudo apt-get remove gcc-arm-none-eabi binutils
```


## Ubuntu &ge; 16.04
The PPA we want in this case is from the [GCC ARM Embedded Maintainer's team](https://launchpad.net/~team-gcc-arm-embedded/+archive/ubuntu/ppa).

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:team-gcc-arm-embedded/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install gcc-arm-embedded
```

## Ubuntu < 16.04
For Ubuntu machines older than 16.04, the answer is to use the `terry.guo/gcc-arm-embedded` PPA.

Add Terry Guo's PPA and install the toolchain.

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:terry.guo/gcc-arm-embedded
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install arm-gcc-none-eabi
```
