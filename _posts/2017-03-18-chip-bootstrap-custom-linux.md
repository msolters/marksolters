## Brief
Here we are going to describe a process to manually build and flash a Linux distribution for a NextThingCo CHIP Pro.  This means you can build e.g. a custom Debian image with specific packages, or even generate an image for a hard drive that is not 4Gb or 512Mb.  In summary, we are going to use:
*  [`multistrap`](https://wiki.debian.org/Multistrap), to generate a custom Linux `rootfs` with our target packages
*  `CHIP-buildroot` to get our CHIP Pro board-specific kernel + modules
*  `CHIP-tools` to synthesize a NAND-ready image from the rootfs, kernel & module; then burn it to the CHIP Pro flash chip

This article will assume an Ubuntu or other Debian-based Linux host as the machine on which development is done.  Mac and especially Windows users, may god have mercy on your souls.

## Gather ye Ingredients
I have a small repository called `CHIP-Pro-custom-linux` that will download and install all that you'll need to get started for a Linux development ("host") environment such as Ubuntu 16.10.

<div class="repo-list row">
  {% for repo in site.github.public_repositories  %}
    {% if repo.name == "CHIP-Pro-custom-linux" %}
      <a href="{{ repo.html_url }}" target="_blank">

                  </div>
              </div>
              <div class="caption">
                  <div class="card-description">

                  </div>
                  <div class="card-text">

                      <span data-toggle="tooltip" class="meta-info" title="{{ repo.forks_count }} forks">
                          <span class="octicon octicon-git-branch"></span> {{ repo.forks_count }}
                      </span>
                      <span data-toggle="tooltip" class="meta-info" title="Last updatedï¼š{{ repo.updated_at }}">
                          <span class="octicon octicon-clock"></span>
                          <time datetime="{{ repo.updated_at }}" title="{{ repo.updated_at }}">{{ repo.updated_at | date: '%Y-%m-%d' }}</time>
                      </span>
                  </div>
              </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </a>
    {% endif %}
  {% endfor %}
</div>

Once you've cloned this repo, you can use the `setup.sh` script to install the rest of what we need:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/msolters/CHIP-Pro-custom-linux
cd CHIP-Pro-custom-linux
sh setup.sh # will need your password to finish installation
```

This will install the packages required for compiling and flashing the CHIP Pro, as well as NextThingCo's `CHIP-SDK` and its constituent dependencies.

Once `setup.sh` can execute (without errors), we're ready to get cooking!

## CHIP-SDK
As you can see in the flow chart, the [`CHIP-SDK` repository](https://github.com/nextthingco/CHIP-SDK) contains most of the software and information we need for flashing the NTC SoCs.

> Ignore the `CHIP-SDK` README's claim about needing VirtualBox, Vagrant, or any of that noise.  A native Linux host is perfectly sufficient for what we are going to do.

Part of `setup.sh` is to execute the [`setup_ubuntu1404.sh` script](https://github.com/NextThingCo/CHIP-SDK/blob/master/setup_ubuntu1404.sh) from the `CHIP-SDK` repo.  If you run into dependency issues early on, check out that script and what it attempts to do.

## Create a Linux Image
We are creating our custom Linux images by first generating "root file systems" or `rootfs` directories, which are literally the `/` directories which shall form the skeleton of our target operating systems.

We are using the program `multistrap` to create our `rootfs`.

> `multistrap` takes in a config file, and outputs a `rootfs`

There are a few `multistrap` config files inside `multistrap-config-examples/*.conf`.  More information about `multistrap` can be found in the [documentation](https://wiki.debian.org/Multistrap).

The provided `CHIP-Pro-custom-linux/create-chip-rootfs.sh` takes a `multistrap` configuration file as its only argument.

```bash
sh create-chip-rootfs.sh multistrap-config-examples/debian-netutils.conf
```

This will auto-generate two different `rootfs` directories:
  *  Buildroot `rootfs` - Only generated if it is missing, as it is time consuming.  This will give us the kernel (`/boot`) and modules ('/lib/modules') specific to the CHIP Pro.
  *  Custom `rootfs` - The custom `rootfs` containing whatever is specified in our `multistrap` config file.

Then, it will stitch these elements together into a single master `rootfs.tar`.  If you want to get into the details on this process, read on.  If you just want to put this software onto your CHIP, skip to [Flashing]({{site.exturl}}/programming/2017/03/18/chip-bootstrap-custom-linux.html#flashing).

## Compile CHIP-buildroot
`CHIP-buildroot` is a fork of [`buildroot`](https://buildroot.org/) that will compile a root file system, or `rootfs`, optimized for the CHIP Pro hardware.  This includes kernel modifications such as a device tree overlay corresponding to the CHIP Pro board.

> One *can* use the vanilla `rootfs` created by `buildroot` as the totality of their target Linux image.  But `buildroot` is incredibly spartan.  `buildroot` does not include any kind of package manager and is better suited for assembling an OS where the software is fixed.  It is not ideal for prototyping!

We just need to compile `CHIP-buildroot` once to get a skeleton `rootfs`, from which we are going to pick out only the `/boot` and `/lib/modules`.

### Compile Requirements
In my experience, GCC v6 will throw errors during the `buildroot` compilation.  The most direct solution I have found is to make sure you have the GCC v5 binary, and then temporarily symlink the default `gcc` binary to point to `gcc-5`:

```bash
sudo apt-get install gcc-5
sudo mv /usr/bin/gcc /usr/bin/gcc.old
sudo ln -s /usr/bin/gcc-5 /usr/bin/gcc

# Make sure to undo these hacks when you are done, e.g.:
#sudo rm /usr/bin/gcc
#sudo mv /usr/bin/gcc.old /usr/bin/gcc
```

### Compile
The actual compilation is simple.  The `make chippro_defconfig` is basically going to overwrite `CHIP-buildroot/.config` with the `CHIP-buildroot/configs/chippro_defconfig` file.

> If you're feeling adventurous, the `.config` can be optionally modified further by using something like `make menuconfig`.

```bash
cd CHIP-SDK/CHIP-buildroot
make chippro_defconfig
make # This can take a while!!
```

### Decompress
When `buildroot` process is complete we will have a final `rootfs.tar` located in `CHIP-SDK/CHIP-buildroot/output/images/rootfs.tar`.  Since we only want the `/boot` and `/lib/modules`, we are going to decompress this archive for later use:

```bash
mkdir /CHIP-buildroot/buildroot-rootfs
tar -xf CHIP-SDK/CHIP-buildroot/output/images/rootfs.tar -C CHIP-SDK/CHIP-buildroot/buildroot-rootfs
```

## Generate Custom rootfs
Now we are going to use `multistrap` different tool to create another, separate, `rootfs`.  `multistrap` allows us to create a more robust `rootfs`, containing almost any package we want out-of-the-box.

> To accomplish this we first fill out a configuration file which contains details about the architecture, Linux distribution, and packages and sources we want to go into our new `rootfs`.

### Install multistrap
```bash
sudo apt-get install multistrap qemu-user-static live-build
```

### Configure multistrap
Multistrap reads a config file that will determine the contents of our `rootfs`.  We can use this config file to specify our distribution flavor, packages, sources, architecture and more.  The following is a simple example that will build a plain Debian system, with a handful of useful networking and sysadmin utilities added in, for a big-endian ARM (`armhf`) architecture:

```
# multistrap-config-examples/debian-netutils.conf

# A slightly more complex example, comprising vanilla Debian
# with a few common utilities for armhf.

[General]
arch=armhf
cleanup=true
noauth=true
unpack=true
debootstrap=Debian Net Utils
aptsources=Debian

[Debian]
packages=apt kmod lsof
source=http://cdn.debian.net/debian/
keyring=debian-archive-keyring
suite=stable
components=main contrib non-free

[Net]
#Basic packages to enable the networking
packages=netbase net-tools ethtool udev iproute iputils-ping ifupdown isc-dhcp-client ssh network-manager
source=http://cdn.debian.net/debian/

[Utils]
#General purpose utilities
packages=locales adduser nano less wget dialog git usbutils passwd sudo
source=http://cdn.debian.net/debian/
```

### Generate multistrap rootfs
This step will be much, much faster than the `CHIP-buildroot` compilation was.  With our config file in hand,

```bash
multistrap -f multistrap-config-examples/debian-netutils.conf -d ./rootfs/
```

The output `rootfs` data will be located in `./rootfs/`.

## Configure and Complete rootfs
Once we have our `rootfs` data, however, it will require further configuration before it is bootable.

### Copy over Buildroot Kernel and Modules
First, we want to get the `/boot` (kernel) and `/lib/modules` (modules) from the `CHIP-buildroot` output:

```bash
cp -r CHIP-SDK/CHIP-buildroot/buildroot-rootfs/boot/* ./rootfs/boot
cp -r CHIP-SDK/CHIP-buildroot/buildroot-rootfs/lib/modules ./rootfs/lib/
```

### Fix Binary Permissions
Usually `sudo` (if you included it in your `multistrap`) and some other system binaries have incorrect permissions by this point, as we were assembling our `rootfs` as a regular user on the host.

```bash
sudo chown root:root -R /bin /usr/bin /usr/sbin
for FILE in /usr/bin/sudo /usr/lib/sudo/sudoers.so /etc/sudoers /etc/sudoers.d /etc/sudoers.d/README /var/lib/sudo
do
  chown root:root $FILE
  chmod 4755 $FILE
done
```

### chroot into the target rootfs
Next, we are going to `chroot` into `rootfs` to complete some of our package configuration and userspace setup.

```
# enables armhf emulation
sudo cp /usr/bin/qemu-arm-static ./rootfs/usr/bin

# chroot into rootfs
sudo LC_ALL=C LANGUAGE=C LANG=C chroot ./rootfs
sudo mount -t proc nodev /proc/
```

Now, we can execute commands almost as if we were booted into our target machine.

### Setup DNS Resolution
If you intend to do networking with your CHIP, it's a good idea to set this so that network apps can resolve domain names.

```bash
echo "nameserver 127.0.0.1" > /etc/resolv.conf
```

### Suppress Excessive Log Output
You may find that the CHIP outputs some annoying logs (such as the RTW WiFi driver) to the interactive console.  This can be avoided by suppressing DMESG output:

```bash
echo "#!/bin/sh -e
#
# rc.local
#
# This script is executed at the end of each multiuser runlevel.
# Make sure that the script will "exit 0" on success or any other
# value on error.
#
# In order to enable or disable this script just change the execution
# bits.
#
# By default this script does nothing.

dmesg -D
exit 0" > /etc/rc.local
```

### Complete Package Config
```bash
dpkg --configure -a
```

> Note: Sometimes it's best to do this one on the board itself, especially for packages that involve system devices: network, sound, etc.  If this throws bugs for you, try running it later once you're up and running on the CHIP Pro.

### Create a New User
```
# Note: do this as root
adduser hero_of_kvatch
usermod -aG sudo hero_of_kvatch
```

### Change Root Password
```bash
# Note: do this as root
passwd
```

### Compress the rootfs
Finally, we just need to compress the `rootfs` contents into a .tar archive.  Exit the `chroot` (`exit` until you're back to your host).  Then:

```bash
cd ./rootfs
tar -cf ../rootfs.tar .
cd ..
```

Now we have a `rootfs.tar`.  We are ready to build and flash a NAND image.

### Remove Emulator when Done
When you're done poking around in the `chroot` you can remove the ARM emulator binary.  Remember, file space on the CHIP Pro is precious!

```bash
sudo rm ./rootfs/usr/bin/qemu-arm-static
```

## Flashing
Now that we have a final `rootfs.tar`, we need to:
*  Build: Combine `rootfs.tar` with a bootloader (`uboot`) to create a final image
*  Flash: Burn that final image to the CHIP Pro flash IC

[`CHIP-Pro-custom-linux/build-and-flash.sh`](https://github.com/msolters/CHIP-Pro-custom-linux/blob/master/build-and-flash.sh) will automate both of these steps.  If you want more details on each of these steps, check out the following two subsections.

### Building the NAND Image
`CHIP-tools` provides a script to perform this step directly, [`chip-create-nand-images.sh`](https://github.com/NextThingCo/CHIP-tools/blob/chip/stable/chip-create-nand-images.sh).  It requires three arguments:

*  Path to CHIP Pro bootloader (`CHIP-SDK/CHIP-buildroot/output/build/uboot-nextthing_2016.01_next`)
*  Path to target `rootfs.tar`
*  Final image output directory (`new-image/`)

```bash
CHIP_TOOLS_PATH="CHIP-Pro-custom-linux/CHIP-SDK/CHIP-tools"
UBOOT_PATH="CHIP-Pro-custom-linux/CHIP-SDK/CHIP-buildroot/output/build/uboot-nextthing_2016.01_next"
ROOTFS_PATH="CHIP-Pro-custom-linux/rootfs.tar"

cd CHIP_TOOLS_PATH
rm -rf new-image # delete any old image
sudo ./chip-create-nand-images.sh $UBOOT_PATH $ROOTFS_PATH new-image
```

### Flashing the NAND Image
This step is simpler, but requires manual user intevention on the hardware side to stay in FEL mode.  Once we have a `new-image/` directory (see previous step), the software command is:

```bash
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER ./new-image # ensure usable data permissions
./chip-flash-nand-images.sh new-image/
```

Then, while holding down the FEL button on the CHIP Pro, connect it to the host PC's micro-USB cable.  After the first `FEL......OK` message, continue holding the FEL button; this should happen twice.  Once the flasher says it is "writing" to the UBI FS, you can then safely let go of the button.

> If you let go of FEL too soon, the flash will most likely time out looking for the CHIP Pro.

## What About Customizing Linux Kernel/Modules?
What if you need `CDC-ACM` drivers enabled for the CHIP Pro, or other kernel modules?

The [`CHIP-linux` repository](https://github.com/nextthingco/chip-linux) is cloned and compiled for you automatically as [a step](https://github.com/NextThingCo/CHIP-buildroot/blob/3f06a6a427297cda2863792e87c551f1209a36c9/linux/linux.mk#L12) of the `CHIP-buildroot` compilation.  If we want to tweak what modules our CHIP Pro kernel will include, we need to override the [default Linux config](https://github.com/NextThingCo/CHIP-buildroot/blob/chip/stable/board/nextthing/chippro/linux.config) of `CHIP-linux`.

[CHIP-buildroot/configs/chippro_defconfig](https://github.com/NextThingCo/CHIP-buildroot/blob/b52c25c67b7bbeb855b3deaa600235962d06c435/configs/chippro_defconfig#L22):
```
...
BR2_LINUX_KERNEL=y
BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_CUSTOM_GIT=y
BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_CUSTOM_REPO_URL="https://github.com/NextThingCo/CHIP-linux"
BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_CUSTOM_REPO_VERSION="nextthing/4.4/chip"
BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_PATCH="wext_priv.patch"
BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_USE_CUSTOM_CONFIG=y
BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_CUSTOM_CONFIG_FILE="$(TOPDIR)/board/nextthing/chippro/linux.config"
BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_ZIMAGE=y
BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_DTS_SUPPORT=y
BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_INTREE_DTS_NAME="ntc-gr8-crumb"
BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_INSTALL_TARGET=y
BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_TOOL_CPUPOWER=y
BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_TOOL_PERF=y
```

By overriding `BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_CUSTOM_REPO_URL` or `BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_CUSTOM_REPO_VERSION`, you can cause `CHIP-buildroot` to use a custom `CHIP-linux` fork.  If you wish to compile code from a local source, simply replace `BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_CUSTOM_GIT=y` with `BR_LINUX_KERNEL_CUSTOM_LOCAL=y`.  (Again, refer to the [makefile](https://github.com/NextThingCo/CHIP-buildroot/blob/3f06a6a427297cda2863792e87c551f1209a36c9/linux/linux.mk#L12))

> You can use `make menuconfig` inside the `CHIP-linux` repo to quickly view or edit the kernel modules graphically.

Then, just `make` `CHIP-buildroot` again.
