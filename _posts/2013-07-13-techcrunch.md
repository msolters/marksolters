I spent a fortnight of September in San Francisco for Techcrunch Disrupt 2013. I was there as a part of Angelhack, with the Chime project.

While there, I participated in the Techcrunch hackathon, hosted by Angelhack. I created an automatic, internet-enabled coffee machine using a Raspberry Pi, Java, PHP, mySQL, and a basic Darlington driver with a bigass (15A) relay. At the end, every team (there were several hundred) got just one minute to present. Here is mine!
