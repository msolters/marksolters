During my sophomore summer of college, I worked as a Patient Transporter for Shands Hospital, in Gainesville, FL. My job was to interact with and safely deliver both patients and all variety of medical equipment to and from almost everywhere in the sprawling two-tower complex that constitutes Shands proper.

CAT scans, dialysis, burns, morgue, gastro, neuro, ER, peds, maternity -- you see it all as a patient transporter. If nothing else, it will build character. There are those of the opinion that everyone should work at least one service job, just to know how much it sucks. They're talking about fast food, bussing, barista, and so forth. After working in trauma units, I think that everyone should work at least one emergency or crises-management job.

Working in a hospital manages to combine all the passive aggressive experiences of retail and service with a high-strung, fast-paced and dangerous environment of stress, confusion, and fear. I often miss this job, if only for want of perspective.
